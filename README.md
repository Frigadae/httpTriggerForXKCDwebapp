# About this code

This function script is written in C# and deployed on Microsoft Azure's functions service. 
It is essential this function runs so that the XKCD web app can successfully fetch a comic.

You can access the XKCD web app [here](https://xkcdsearchwebapp.netlify.app/).

The repository for the XKCD web app can be found [here](https://github.com/wang-yi-yao/xkcdWebapp).

### Current State as of 2025
This code was originally hosted on Microsoft Azure as a HTTP trigger. 
Due to other commitments going on, I decided to remove the resource to not incur unnecessary storage and hosting costs.
